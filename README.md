# fancon

[![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-APACHE2-blue.svg)]()

A Linux fan control daemon and fan testing tool, allowing custom speed-temperature curves for fans, controllable by either PWM or RPM, or percentage.
  - High performance
  - Low memory usage
  - Support for system fans, and NVIDIA GPUs

Low overhead and easy, meaningful configuration are the main goals of fancon, this is achieved by:
  - Extensive multi-threading support
  - Use of C++ and performance profiling
  - Standard text file configuration - /etc/fancon.conf
  - Fan characteristic testing - allowing more meaningful speed configuration such as through fan RPM or percentage, not just PWM like similar tools
  - Speed percentage support (e.g. 65%) rather than cryptic fan-dependent PWM values (e.g. 142)
  - Fans may be turned off (for example, when system is not under load) with a guaranteed start when they are required
