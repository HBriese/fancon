# fancon

[![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-APACHE2-blue.svg)]()

fancon is a C++ userspace fan control tool, supporting both Linux and Mac OS X, allowing custom speed-temperature curve for each individual fan, controllable by either PWM or RPM.

  - High performance
  - Low memory usage
  - High test coverage

Low overhead and easy configuration are the main goals of fancon, this is achieved by:
  - Use of C++, multi-threading, and optimized STL functions
  - Text file configuration, great for headless machines - at /etc/fancon.conf
  - Fan characteristic testing - all fans are not equal, so testing enables RPM fan speed configuration, not just PWM control like similar tools
  - Support for stopping fans (for example, if not under load) and correct handling of required fan PWM for start


### Installation

###### Install fancon snap:

Snap [installation instructions](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install)

```sh
$ sudo snap install --beta --classic fancon
```

###### Build from source:
gcc may be substituted for clang

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/HBriese/fancon.git
$ sudo apt-get install gcc make cmake lm-sensors rsyslog libc++-dev libstdc++6 linux-libc-dev libsensors4-dev libboost-filesystem-dev
$ mkdir fancon/Release && cd fancon/Release && cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make && sudo make install
```


### Runtime Dependencies

fancon aims to be widely deployable with minimum runtime dependencies:

| Name (package) | Usage |
| -------------- | ----- |
| [lm-sensors] | A sensor monitoring tool|
| syslog supported logger <br> (tested with [rsyslog]) | Log handling |
