### Installation
[Download release package](https://github.com/hbriese/fancon/releases/latest)
OR [build from source](#building-from-source)

##### Ubuntu, Debian (.deb)
```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./fancon*.deb; sudo apt install -f
```

##### Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS (.rpm)
```bash
sudo yum –nogpgcheck install ./fancon*.rpm
```

### Configuration
***/etc/fancon.conf*** is automatically created on first run once the tests complete

**Only 'sensor' & 'temp_to_rpm' for each fan is required to be manually
 configured**

```text
config {
  update_interval: 1000             # Milliseconds between updating fan speeds
  dynamic: true                     # Interpolate speeds between temps e.g (30: 800, 50: 1200) results in 1000 @ 40 
  smoothing_intervals: 3            # Intervals over which to smooth RPM changes
  top_stickiness_intervals: 2       # Intervals to wait before decreasing RPM
  temp_averaging_intervals: 3       # Intervals to average temperatures over - eliminating temp spikes
}

        #  75: 50%      50% of max RPM at 75°C, could also be written as 75: 180PWM in this case
        #  194f: 100%   Full speed at 90°C   (194f = 90°C)

                                      → increasing improves testing accuracy but makes the test take longer

### Usage

```text
fancon argument=value ...
-h  help         Show this help
    start        Start the fan controller (default: true)
-s  stop         Stop the fan controller
-r  reload       Forces the fan controller to reload all data
-t  test         Force tests of all fans found
-ts test-safely  Test fans one at a time to avoid stopping all fans at once (default: false)
                   at once, avoiding high temps but significantly increasing duration
-c  config       Configuration file (default: /etc/fancon.conf)
-l  log-lvl      Sets the logging level: info, debug, trace, warning, error (default: info)
-d  daemonize    Daemonize the process (default: false)
-i  system-info  Save system info to the current directory
                   (file name default: fancon_system_info.txt)
```

#### FAQ

##### My fans aren't detected

First try detecting devices using lm-sensors
```bash
sudo sensors-detect
```
- You may need to reboot if unloaded kernel modules were added

Check to see if your device is detected
```bash
sensors
```

##### Fancon complains my device is mis-configured or unsupported

Devices (fans & sensors) that:
- Expose a sysfs like interface but are not found by lm-sensors
- Are reported as not having the required features but they do

**May** be configurable by [altering their configuration](#configuration) 

### Building from source:
##### With NVIDIA support:
```bash
sudo apt install clang cmake lm-sensors libsensors5 libsensors4-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-log-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libpstreams-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libgrpc++-dev protobuf-compiler protobuf-compiler-grpc libxnvctrl-dev libx11-dev

git clone https://github.com/hbriese/fancon.git && cd fancon; mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DNVIDIA_SUPPORT=ON .. && make -j && sudo make install
```

##### Without NVIDIA support:
```bash
sudo apt install clang cmake lm-sensors libsensors5 libsensors4-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-log-dev libpthread-stubs0-dev libpstreams-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libgrpc++-dev protobuf-compiler protobuf-compiler-grpc

git clone https://github.com/hbriese/fancon.git && cd fancon; mkdir build; cd build
